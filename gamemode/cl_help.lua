		{ "Player Rules",
		[[By playing our server, you agree to obey these rules and understand that punishment is subjective to the staff member handling your case.

		Enforcement of these rules are discretionary to staff members. This list is not absolute, and may be updated with additions or addendums at any time.
		
		Conduct Rules:

		1. Under no circumstances are players and staff permitted to communicate in a derogatory, harmful, or in a discriminatory manner against other players and staff on server, on the forums, or in official TnB Discord channels. This includes hate speech, personal attacks, cyber bullying, etc.
			*Some forms of discrimination include racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic content.
			*Political discourse is heavily monitored and will be subjected to punishment should the offending comments cause distress, provoke a reaction or emotionally rouse other players.
		2. Attempting to and/or engaging in the misuse of script glitches or exploits in the event to gain advantage over a player or environment will result in immediate punishment. Severity will be determined by the actions taken and the parties accounted for.
			*If players do find exploitable issues with the script, they are encouraged to inform developers discreetly. pirate pirate Chiss Chiss are the current developers available to contact. If you cannot reach them and feel it is time sensitive feel free to reach out to any of the Team Leads Annoying Rooster Annoying Rooster Chad Chad
		3. Illegal actions in our community will be met with a permanent removal with no opportunity to appeal if proven with indisputable evidence. This includes swatting community members, sexual harassment or sexual interactions with minors, using a player or staff's personal information to blackmail or threaten them, and others.
		
		Roleplay Rules:

		1. Players and staff should be able to differentiate between Out of Character (OOC) and In Character (IC). Out of Character is when you are an actor backstage. In Character is when you, as an actor, are on the stage performing the role of a character.
			*Players are encouraged to report instances of IC and OOC conflation to Moderators so it can be corrected. Repeat offenses are subject to short-term punishment.
			*If you are OOC or not actively roleplaying, do not interrupt others' IC engagements. Likewise, if you are IC and another player states they are not ready to roleplay or are AFK, you cannot force them to go IC. Also, if caught multiple times to pretend to be AFK to avoid roleplay you will be punished accordingly.
		
		2. Shoot to Roleplay (S2RP) and Shoot to Kill (S2K) are part of the server. The standard setting will always be Shoot to Roleplay, but once the scene escalates to a point where it becomes difficult to monitor time scaling, a majority from all parties must consent to turning the conflict into a Shoot to Kill setting.
			*In order to engage conflict, Shoot to Miss (S2M) on contact is acceptable in order to initiate. Once initiated, parties can select between their preference of S2RP or S2K.
				*If no Moderators or Game Masters are available to confirm the switch from S2RP to S2K, players can initiate by voting over OOC. Majority wins.
			*S2RP naturally runs in a turn order. The initiating party must wait for all members of the receiving party to emote before moving to the second (2nd) turn. An exchange of emotes from both parties is considered one (1) turn. Turn order will be enforced by staff if;
				*There are too many players in the engagement
				*A majority of participants want turn order to be enforced by a third party
				*Issues with timescale
			*Timescale happens when S2RP occurs. Imagine it as an invisible sphere of influence where the parties involved are engaged in their emotes and cannot be intruded upon by those outside of it until the exchanges reach a certain point. This is to prevent the time dilation and inherently slow nature between typing, awaiting a response, and replying interfering with the realities of how quickly most conflicts would occur in real life. It ensures that everyone can clearly think their emotes out, process others' emotes, and prevents those with slower typing speeds, reading comprehension speeds, or ESL players to be strong armed into outcomes by others. Not only does it account for what was mentioned but it also prevents third parties from abusing or accidentally walking into others with the limited nature of Garry's Mod maps to interfere with conflicts. It is not a full proof system and there will be kinks, so bear with us for now until we unveil a better script implemented system to solve the inherent hiccups of Timescale. This will be monitored, adjusted, and most importantly enforced by Game Masters and Moderators.
		
		3. Metagaming is defined as abusing Out of Character (OOC) information to gain an edge on an In Character (IC) scenario. Metagame is a bannable offense depending on the severity.
			*Metagame can be conscious or unconscious. Try to be mindful of what information your character would realistically have access to.
			*Game Masters may manipulate scenarios for the benefit of the player by using information gathered by observation and implementing it IC. This is a special case of metagame where it is done without malice and improves storytelling and player experience.
		
		4. Powergaming is defined as forcing an outcome in your favor against reason, it is prohibited and a bannable offense if multiple instances occur. Try to use your better judgment and acknowledge when a fellow roleplayer may have gotten the best of you. Players are encouraged to use nondefinitive language when emoting to allow for a counter-emote.
			*Forcing an environmental change without player or staff consent, refusing/ignoring consequences proposed to you, or dictating the outcome of your emote are all considered powergame.
				*Edge cases exist where the opposing player is incapacitated and cannot reasonably react, or where attacks of advantage occur such as a sneak attack or a maneuver that would be impossible to dodge. These are monitored at staff discretion.
			*Powergame is not exclusive to combat situations. Unreasonable cases of listening to conversations through walls via script insufficiencies or feigning that your character has knowledge of a skill for convenience are considered noncombative powergame.
			*Game Masters may at times force certain actions to occur as a means of storytelling, which is not considered powergame.
			*Players may choose to take a Permanent Injury (PI) or Temporary Injury (TI) in the place of an NLR or even after S2K. PIs require consistent upkeep from the player and will be monitored by staff to ensure reversals don't occur during crucial moments in roleplay.
		
		5. New Life Rule (NLR) is the concept that when your character is killed in a way that an NPC could have provided the same amount of substance and character development for the opposing party you may respawn with whatever prior knowledge, experience, and items your character has up until the point the conflict in which you died began.
		
			*Examples of NLR include but may not be limited to;
				- Being hit and killed by a grenade or suppressive fire during a faction conflict
				- Dying from an NPC Mutant
				- Stepping or falling into a script anomaly
				- Shoot to Kill conflicts
		
		6. Unless the character could have easily been replaced with an NPC and can take an NLR, all roleplayed deaths begin the PK, or Permanent Kill process.
			*Once a player is killed, and the aggressor is seeking a PK, they must immediately inform the player that they are Temporarily Killed (TK) for a period of three (3) days in which time they are seeking PK authorizations. The TKed player may not play on this character during this process.
				*If the PK is not approved within three (3) days of the killing, the authorization is void and the player can continue to use their character.
				*If the PK is approved, the player may not continue to use the character, and is prohibited from switching items between characters unless authorized by the Game Masters.
				All players reserve the right to appeal a PK, even after it is approved by the Game Masters and Moderators or even in cases of Negligence PKs. Exceptions for the three (3) day grace period will be made when necessary but it will not be common. This is due to how PKs affect character development and progression of narratives on server.
			*If the player wishes to loot the TK'd character, they may do so in the three (3) day grace period. If the PK is not approved, all items looted from the TK will be forcibly removed from the player's inventory if not voluntarily turned in.
				*Looted items may not be used to commit other TKs or other important story objectives that would affect in-game consequences if they were to be removed. If sold the ruble amount will be removed instead.
			*Players must take screenshots of the character they have killed and are awaiting PK auths. Killed players must take screenshots of their inventory before they are looted.
			*When initiating a PK, if the person attempting to PK a player is killed in reverse, they are subject to an automatic negligence PK.
		
		7. “Failure to roleplay” is an umbrella term for violating baseline roleplay quality and is punishable if repeat offenses occur. Being new to roleplay or being an English Second Language (ESL) speaker is not the same thing as deliberately roleplaying in a manner that is obstructive, intentionally annoying, or low quality.
			*Examples include roleplaying with no value for life, walking out of roleplay in the middle of a scenario, ignoring roleplay that is directed towards you, etc.
			*All players should be able to roleplay realistic concern for their character's life and self preservation. “Going Rambo”, unprecedented suicidal actions or behaviors, or flippant disregard for losing your character can diminish the consequences of a situation and is punishable. The most common punishment is made in the manner of a Negligence PK, which are automatic PKs placed upon a character that demonstrates total disregard for life. These are appealable.
		
		8. During robbery roleplay, if surrounded in what could be deemed as an unsurvivable encounter, you must comply to the demands of the robbers or face an automatic negligence PK. While you are not forced to surrender, if you fail to comply and are killed as consequence, you will be automatically PK'd. You may appeal this PK but keep in mind they are rarely accepted due to the negligence typically required to reach this point, there are of course edge cases and exceptions that may be made.
			*You may not rob a player of their valuables and immediately NLR them after. This is considered low quality roleplay and detrimental not only to that person and their character but the server around them suffers as well. If caught doing this you will be punished severely.
			*All factions except for The Brotherhood and other Bandit factions (in rare circumstances staff can make exceptions) may only take 1 of 4 value itemswhen robbing a player.
				- A weapon and its ammunition
				- Any suit
				- 50% of the victim's rubles, up to 50,000ru
				- All of their artifacts
			Items not considered value items include anything not listed here, such as food, ammunition, junk items, etc.
			*Members of The Brotherhood and other Bandit factions may rob any vulnerable player if more than 3 members initiate the robbery for whatever they like. Keep in mind that petty theft is not typical of organized Bandits and must be acted upon for proper, premeditated reasoning. Bandits who regularly engage in this behavior may be subject to negligence PKs and other administrative action.
			*If you lack the inventory space or weight capacity to take an item that is robbed, you are not permitted to empty out inventory space and weight to do so. This includes actions such as using all consumables, dropping junk items, stashing things during the robbery to make room, etc.
				*Roleplaying leaving behind items to make space is permitted, but it should not distract or disrupt the flow of the robbery roleplay. If multiple instances of this are seen by staff to be blurring the line between IC and OOC you will be warned and then punished if you do not correct the behavior.
		
		9. Random deathmatch (RDM), or shooting/punching/killing anyone on server unprovoked and without roleplay is prohibited. Report this offense to Moderators with a paste of the console kill log, and video evidence if possible.
		
		10. If there are less than 5 members of a faction on the server, then it is to be assumed that their base is guarded by IC Guards. This means that players are prohibited from breaking into or entering bases without permission from faction members with the intention of attacking or robbing the base.
		
		11. No sexually explicit acts are permitted on the server. Offenders will be warned once and subject to a short-term ban if repeated.
		
		12. Players reserve the right to refuse any roleplay they are not comfortable with conducting, such as scenarios involving gore, torture, agony, and extremely detailed violent narratives. You may choose to be removed from the scenario (OOC) or fade to black.
		
		13. Pre-approved character auths may be revoked at any time if the player demonstrates unreasonable behavior or violates any rules listed here.]]

		{"Staff Rules",
		[[The following is a set of guidelines that staff members moving forward will be expected to adhere to. This list is non-exhaustive, subject to change, and staff members will still be held accountable for behavior that negatively impacts the community even if it isn't explicitly outlined here.
		
		First and foremost, the golden rule: staff members will be held accountable for not respecting the expectations we have provided for players as a whole:

			*Respect is earned, not given. This is a two way street. You should strive to earn players' trust and respect by showing them why you deserve it. Be kind; do not make demands.
			*Everyone makes mistakes. You are not perfect. Nobody is. Have the decorum to own your errors and apologize to those affected by them. Encourage players to do the same, and be kind when they do.
			*Rules against metagaming will be enforced with extra discretion against staff members. Staff members have access to much privileged information and must be trusted not to use that information to guide their in-character actions beyond what is agreed upon by the rest of the team for narrative reasons. Using it to gain an advantage on your “main character” will not only be met with removal - it will be met with a ban.
			*Your actions as a staff member carry more weight than a player’s - this is a psychological thing that is difficult, if not impossible to escape from. Therefore, you must be extra diligent to avoid powergaming, even unintentionally. Players will be less likely to call you out than they would another player if they feel you are being unfair, and will walk away feeling burned.
			*Accept consequences. As a staff member, you are expected to set the tone for the server. If we expect players to calmly accept loss - be that a roleplayed fight, a valuable item or even a character - we must lead by example in this field and accept the hand that is dealt to us.
		
		When a player acts out, start by talking to them. Opening a line of dialogue with someone who has violated a rule or has generally been a nuisance can sometimes result in unexpected turn arounds. Do not shoot from the hip - lead with an open palm and a soft voice. Most situations do not require use of administrative powers.
		
		It is OK to partake in occasional hijinks and tomfoolery on the server, but you have a responsibility to encourage and protect roleplay when it is occurring. Sometimes players need to unwind after an intense scene. You can help them relax, but do not allow it to disrupt and distract roleplay that is still ongoing.
		
		Use of your powers to give yourself or other players an unfair advantage, or to harass and discourage players you do not like, will be met with swift removal and a ban. Examples include but are not limited to:
		
			*Spawning items for yourself or for other players outside of the guided auth process and outside of the purview of discretionary refunds.
			*Spawning NPCs or anomalies to kill or damage players.
			*Spawning NPCs for players to cheese for loot drops.
			*Using observe and seeall to grant yourself an edge in combat (S2RP or S2K).
			*Ignoring legitimate help requests from players you do not like.
			*Granting excessive experience points to players.
			*Targeting players you do not like with excessive punishments for minor offenses.
			*Letting your friends off easy for behavior you would otherwise punish harshly for.
		
		Raise all concerns with other staff members respectfully and privately with dialogue. If you feel you cannot resolve an issue with a fellow staff member, consult with upper administration members.
		
		All staff must be reachable on the forums, discord, or steam by the public. When taking on the role you must be able to be contacted privately by anyone in the community. This is to ensure transparency and prevent staff members from offloading their responsibility unto others of being a point of contact between the staff team and the public.
		
		If you need to take a break, take a break. You are not expected to work through burnout. Just make sure you notify your team lead so we can maintain an accurate head count.
		
		Criminal behavior of any sort against community members will result in swift removal and an automatic, permanent community ban.

		We are posting this where players can see it as part of our transparency initiative. If you, as a player, feel a staff member's actions went against these guidelines or the good-faith spirit of the guidelines and are not comfortable talking to them yourself, please do not hesitate to contact their Team Lead, an SCL, or an RDA.]]

		Register your username if you want to be able to message people privately by right-clicking your PDA in the F3 inventory menu and selecting "register".
		If your PDA is annoying you, you can turn it off by selecting "turn off".

		The Map feature is currently under development, and does nothing for now.

		The Journal allows you to take personal notes. Tap the green "New entry" button to create a new entry.
		Select a title for your entry, then fill out the contents. Handy for writing poems, documenting important information about your enemies, and saving the location of your stash.
		Keep in mind that you cannot edit journals once you have saved them, so changes will have to made as a new entry. Also, you are not given a prompt when selecting "Delete", so make sure you don't lose all your work by pressing it on accident.

		The Contacts tab allows you to view all other active PDA users connected to your network.

		The Messages tab will log and date messages you send and receive.

		Extra functions and updates to your PDA system may come overtime! Check back here to learn about new functions.]] 
		},
		{ "Tooltrust", [[By default, you don't have tooltrust. You have phystrust, and you have proptrust. Phys- and proptrust give you a physgun and the ability to spawn props respectively. Tooltrust gives you a toolgun.

		Advanced tooltrust gives you most tools, an increased prop limit, and increased prop spawn permissions. Advanced tooltrust users' props are solid, whereas basic and non tooltrusted props are no-collided. To get this, ask a staff member.
		
		Staff can take away phys and proptrust if you abuse the privillege - you can get it back through the forums.]] 
		},
		{ "Stockpiles", [[Stockpiles are an extended inventory system outside of your regular F3 inventory menu. Stockpiles are mandatory for Technicians and Traders to conduct business and use their features. Stockpiles are also recommended for factions and PBGs to store extra gear.  Not all players may be granted a Stockpile; you must have a need and a right to have one. 
		
		Regular players cannot spawn the Stockpile entity themselves, they must ask a staff member to spawn one for them. Stockpiles will already be naturally dispersed throughout the map.
		
		You can ask a moderator to give you access to someone else's Stockpile, and vice versa. Stockpile names are global.
			
		Pressing E on a Stockpile lets you see the contents. Right-clicking items in your inventory and selecting "stockpile" will send them to the Stockpile you choose from the menu. You can only send items to your Stockpile if you are standing near it.
		
		Traders use Stockpiles to get money back from items they buy from players by selecting "sell to stockpile for Xru". Furthermore, Traders and Technicians cannot access their business menu if they are not standing near a stockpile. Technicians cannot upgrade gear without standing near a Stockpile.]]
		},
		{ "Looting", [[ZoneControl has a custom loot system that procs based on the amount of players on server and the proximity of a player to a spawner. There are three tiers of loot that can be scavenged from automatic spawners;
		Worthless
		Common
		Uncommon
		
		In order to get a better chance of finding loot, you should travel across the map with a few friends. The radius of item detection is rather small, so look closely for anything in the bushes and grass that seems out of the ordinary!
		
		Artifacts are manually placed by staff, and do not follow the same system as generated loot. In order to find most artifacts, you'll need to equip an artifact detector. Note that some artifacts are more rare and require better detectors to find. Also, anomaly traversing is dangerous; some artifacts are simply not meant to be looted, even if you've found it.]]
		},
		{ "Radiation", [[In the Zone, radiation is the most common enemy one can face. Ingesting more radiation by standing in an irradiated zone or eating irradiated food will slowly deplete your maximum health over time. You'll /appear/ healthy in your health bar, but you'll be extremely weak in reality. Staff can see your true health by using the seeall function.
			
		In order to better protect yourself against radiation, you should consider purchasing a Geiger Counter and a few dosimeters. A Geiger Counter will detect how much radiation is emanating in the area you are standing; the closer you are to the radiation source, the more the needle will stabilize. You can equip a Geiger Counter to use as an on-screen UI feature.
		
		Dosimeters are disposable radiation detectors that work by detecting how much radiation you have been directly exposed to, up to 25 roentgens. Dosimeters don't ever decrease their value, so once one is maxed out, you can consider it trash and activate a new one.
		
		Using dosimeters and geiger counters together is extremely useful for detecting whether or not you are truly irradiated. If your geiger counter is ticking, but your newly activated dosimeter hasn't budged from zero, it's likely that you are standing near a player who is irradiated. Irradiated players cannot irradiate you, but you can detect whether or not they are irradiated and alert them so they may take medicine for it.
		
		Radiation is healed with certain medkits, antirads, and certain food items.]]
