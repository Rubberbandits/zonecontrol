ITEM.Name =  "Bloodsucker tentacles";
ITEM.Desc =  "Bloodsucker tentacles contain a special gland which produces an enzyme capable of dissolving the skin and simultaneously preventing blood from clotting. Discovering the enzyme's composition could be the cornerstone of a whole series of great medical advances. Some stalkers tend to use bloodsucker teeth to make necklaces and charms. It is thus safe to say that bloodsucker jaw is one of the most popular pieces of jewelry found in the Zone.";
